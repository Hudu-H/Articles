This page was built with **React**, **React-Redux** for the frontend and **Express.js & Node.js** for backend with **Mongodb** as the database.

## Motive

The intention of building this project was part of a process to learn react-redux, that is to pass data and manage state accross different pages within an application. This enable users to interact with the page with all CRUD operations, that create posts, read, update, or delete posts they created.
